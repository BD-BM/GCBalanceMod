[1] SETUP
====================================
This tool has to be run from the GC data directory [..gc\data\] (it is mandatory, else the sdf's won't be created properly).


[2] HOW TO USE
====================================
The program interface is a list all the files going to be packed into the SDF(s) and some command buttons.

  [2.1] ADD FILES
  To add files to a sdf, you can either press Add Files and then select a group of files (choosing directories isn't possible).
  NOTE: This could also be done with drag-drop to the list. This way you can add directories directly, without having to add the files in them.
  
  [2.2] DELETE FILES
  Delete files can be used to remove files from the list.
  
  [2.3] CREATE SDF
  When pressing Create SDF, you name the sdf(s), which is then created (which can take a couple of minutes).


[3] THE RESULT
====================================
Depending on content you will get one or two sdf's, which can be used as a mod for GC. Normal data will be packed into <name>0.sdf and streaming data into <name>1.sdf.
Example: MyMod0.sdf - all files containing graphics and text
         MyMod1.sdf - sound, music and videos
